# Omada Take Home Test

## Description
The Omada Project is an Android Studio based app written in Java. Within the project, I created a single activity that implements a slider.
The slider includes four different quotes from the Star Wars movies. Each movie quote is placed on it's own slider and it also includes
the authors name. I also added in a related image to add a bit more interest to each slide and make it look a bit more professional. 

## Installation 
Download all of the files from the respository by cloning the respository. 
Import the project into Android Studios.
Run the project in Android Studios.

## Usage
